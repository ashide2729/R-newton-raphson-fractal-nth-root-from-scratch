# R-newton-raphson-fractal-nth-root-from-scratch
The repository contains the code of Newton Raphson written in R language from scratch using mathematical equations without using any library.  The R script for Newton Raphson is a well commented document to help understand  every step with proper explanation.

The written code can help find nth root for any equation and is not limited in implementation. 

The code also helps implement the graphical implementation of Newton Raphson by plotting the convergence of the roots and hence resulting in a fractal as shown in the image.
